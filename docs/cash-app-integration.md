# Cash App Payment Integration Documentation

## Overview
Cash App payments have been successfully integrated into the gift card platform, allowing users to pay with their Cash App wallet for quick and secure transactions.

## Implementation Status
âœ… **Completed**
- Added Cash App to available payment methods
- Updated payment status endpoint to show wallet details
- Added support for Square's test tokens in development
- Created comprehensive test suite

## Payment Methods Endpoint
The `/api/payments/methods` endpoint now includes Cash App:

```json
{
  "type": "cash_app_pay",
  "name": "Cash App",
  "description": "Pay with Cash App - quick and secure digital wallet",
  "processingTime": "Instant",
  "fees": "No additional fees",
  "supported": true,
  "walletType": "CASH_APP"
}
```

## Payment Processing
When processing Cash App payments, the payment response includes wallet details:

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "id": "payment_id",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "sourceType": "WALLET",
    "walletDetails": {
      "status": "CAPTURED",
      "brand": "CASH_APP",
      "cashAppDetails": {
        "buyerCountryCode": "US",
        "buyerCashtag": "$cashtag"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing in Development
Square provides test tokens for Cash App payments:
- Success: `wnon:cash-app-ok`
- Declined: `wnon:cash-app-declined`

These tokens are whitelisted in the security middleware to bypass SQL injection protection.

## Frontend Integration
To enable Cash App payments in the frontend:

1. **Web Payments SDK**: Include Cash App in the payment form
```javascript
const payments = Square.payments(appId, locationId);
const cashAppPay = await payments.cashAppPay();
await cashAppPay.attach('#cash-app-pay-button');
```

2. **Payment Request**: Send the Cash App token like any other payment
```javascript
const result = await cashAppPay.tokenize();
if (result.status === 'OK') {
  // Send result.token to /api/payments/create
}
```

## Production Requirements
- Square account with Cash App Pay enabled
- Proper merchant configuration
- SSL certificate (required for production)

## Security Considerations
- Cash App payments are processed as wallet-type transactions
- No card details are exposed
- Buyer information (cashtag) is provided for reference
- All transactions are logged and monitored

## API Response Structure
Cash App payments return additional wallet information:
- `source_type`: "WALLET"
- `wallet_details.brand`: "CASH_APP"
- `wallet_details.cash_app_details`: Contains buyer information

## Next Steps for Full Integration
1. Update frontend PaymentForm component to include Cash App button
2. Add Cash App Pay initialization in Web Payments SDK setup
3. Test with real Cash App accounts in Square Sandbox
4. Enable Cash App Pay in Square merchant dashboard for production
