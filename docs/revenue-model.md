# SiZu GiftCard Revenue Model

## Executive Summary

The SiZu GiftCard platform generates revenue through multiple streams, creating a sustainable and profitable business model. Industry data shows that digital gift card platforms can achieve 30-50% gross margins with proper optimization.

## Primary Revenue Streams

### 1. Float Income (35% of revenue)
**What is it?**: Money held between purchase and redemption
- **How it works**: When a customer buys a $100 gift card, you hold that money until it's redeemed
- **Revenue opportunity**: Invest this float in treasury bills, money market funds, or high-yield savings
- **Expected return**: 3-5% annually on average float balance
- **Example**: $1M average float × 4% annual return = $40,000/year

**Optimization strategies**:
- Encourage longer expiration dates (2-5 years)
- Promote gift cards during high-interest rate environments
- Implement auto-reload features to maintain float levels

### 2. Breakage Revenue (25% of revenue)
**What is it?**: Unredeemed gift card balances
- **Industry average**: 10-20% of gift cards are never fully redeemed
- **Revenue recognition**: After expiration or dormancy period (typically 2-5 years)
- **Example**: $500,000 in annual sales × 15% breakage = $75,000 revenue

**Optimization strategies**:
- Set reasonable expiration dates (not too short to anger customers)
- Send reminder emails to reduce abandonment
- Offer small denomination cards that are more likely to have leftover balances

### 3. Transaction Fees (20% of revenue)
