## Overview

The Web Payments SDK supports accepting payments from Apple Pay and Google Pay. These digital wallet payment methods share a common code pattern with specific differences described in [Take an Apple Pay Payment](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/apple-pay) and [Take an Google Pay Payment](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/google-pay). Both payment methods are initialized by creating a [PaymentRequest](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments/objects/PaymentRequest) that can be used for either payment method.

## Digital wallet payment methods

The digital wallet payment methods render digital buttons. Any combination of payment methods can be rendered on a single page as shown in the following images:

- The [Apple Pay](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/apple-pay) and [Card](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks) payment methods:

![web-payments : apple pay : hero](https://images.ctfassets.net/1nw4q0oohfju/3rsUA1pFNNW2hwB5NN3hTX/e994fb0788e20e608386ab0682b6f99c/ApplePayHero.png?fm=webp)

- The [Google Pay](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/google-pay) and [Card](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks) payment methods:

![web-payments : google pay : hero](https://images.ctfassets.net/1nw4q0oohfju/6w8follbLcTb8Cd4BVLDKD/4993f4fd605c449c6e402df851a50576/GooglePayHero_2x.png?fm=webp)


The digital wallet payment methods let you provide payment request details and expose events to your application so that it can react to a buyer's actions on the digital wallet payment sheet.

#### Important

To enhance payment security, use the `verifyBuyer` function to apply [Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/sca-overview) and verify the cardholder's identity. SCA should be used for all customer-initiated transactions, including digital wallet payments. If SCA isn't initiated for digital wallet payments, the transactions might be declined due to a lack of authentication.
