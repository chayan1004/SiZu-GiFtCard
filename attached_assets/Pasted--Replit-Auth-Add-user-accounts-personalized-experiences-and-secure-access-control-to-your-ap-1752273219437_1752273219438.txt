# Replit Auth

> Add user accounts, personalized experiences, and secure access control to your app. Enterprise-grade authentication that works with a single Agent prompt.

Replit Auth lets you create personalized user experiences in your app. With user accounts, you can save user preferences, create custom dashboards, build social features, control access to premium content, and track user activity—all the features that make apps engaging and valuable.

Instead of spending months building authentication from scratch, Replit Auth gives you enterprise-grade capabilities with a single Agent prompt. Powered by the same infrastructure as Fortune 500 companies—Firebase, Google Cloud Identity Platform, reCAPTCHA, Stytch, and Clearout—you get professional-level security, fraud prevention, and global scale built in.

## Why use Replit Auth

Authentication is a challenging problem that entire companies dedicate themselves to solving. Your app's primary purpose likely isn't authentication - it's whatever unique idea or solution you're building.

Replit Auth offers:

* **Zero setup** - Add authentication with a single prompt in Agent
* **Built-in security** - Uses Replit's infrastructure with protections against common attacks
* **User management** - Simplified user administration through the Auth pane
* **Database integration** - Automatic user entries in your database
* **Customizable login page** - Personalize the login experience for your app
* **Password reset** - Replit sends password reset emails for you, so you don't need to set up your own email delivery provider
* **Development and Deployments** - Replit Auth works seamlessly across development (replit.dev), and deployments (replit.app, and custom domains)

## Enterprise-grade infrastructure

Replit Auth is more than simple user management—it's a fully managed authentication solution built on enterprise-grade infrastructure. This powerful combination gives your app the same authentication capabilities used by Fortune 500 companies:

* **Firebase & Google Cloud Identity Platform** - Enterprise-tier SLA with Google's battle-tested authentication infrastructure
* **Advanced security scanning** - Automatic protection against bots and malicious actors with reCAPTCHA integration
* **Fraud prevention** - Email verification and validation powered by Clearout to prevent fake accounts
* **Multi-factor authentication** - Secure login options backed by Stytch's enterprise authentication platform
* **Global scale** - Built to handle millions of users with automatic scaling and reliability

This enterprise foundation means you can focus on building your app's unique features while knowing your authentication is powered by the same infrastructure that secures billion-dollar companies. Instead of spending months integrating multiple services, you get all these capabilities with a single Agent prompt.

## Getting started with Replit Auth

The only way to implement Replit Auth is by using Agent. Simply include a request for Replit Auth in your prompt:

```
Help me create an app that [your app idea] and should feature Replit Auth.
```

Agent will set up all the necessary code and configurations for authentication. Manual implementation is not supported, as Agent handles all the complexity for you.

You can customize the login page to match your app's branding:

1. Navigate to the Auth pane in your Replit workspace
2. Click on **Configure**
3. Customize the following elements:
   * App name
   * App icon
   * Login methods (Google, GitHub, X, Apple, Email)

Your changes will immediately appear on your app's login page.

## Connecting user data with your database

Replit Auth automatically creates user entries in your database. This makes it easy to store user-specific data. Agent will guide you on properly connecting user data with your database.

## Security considerations

Replit Auth leverages Replit's infrastructure, providing built-in protections against common security threats. However, you should still follow these best practices:

* Always validate user authentication server-side before performing sensitive operations
* Never store sensitive information like passwords in your code
* Use environment variables for any API keys or secrets
* Implement proper access controls for user data

* [Security checklist for vibe coding](/tutorials/vibe-code-security-checklist)

## Referrals

To encourage applications that teach people about Replit, any user that signs up via Replit Auth will automatically be added to your pending Replit Referrals. If they later upgrade to Replit Core, you will receive any referral bonus you are entitled to according to the current terms of the referral program.

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

1. **User not recognized after login**
   * If you're experiencing issues, ask [Replit Assistant](/replitai/assistant) for help debugging your authentication implementation.

2. **Custom icon not displaying**
   * Make sure the icon URL is accessible and in a supported format (PNG or JPG).

3. **Newly linked custom domain isn't working**
   * Redeploy to refresh the domain list (REPLIT\_DOMAINS environment variable).
