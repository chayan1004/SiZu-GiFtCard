## Overview

You can add a payment method to the application you built using the quickstart project sample in [Web Payments SDK Quickstart](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/quickstart) to integrate the Web Payments SDK into your application.

The following steps add code to the application you created from the [quickstart project sample](https://github.com/square/web-payments-quickstart). If you haven't created an application using the quickstart, you need to do so before completing these steps.

Square supports instant authentication through [Plaid](https://plaid.com/products/auth) for verifying a buyer's bank account before making an ACH payment. Plaid lets your application quickly authenticate the bank account and uses the Web Payments SDK to connect to the ACH network to accept payments.

The following is the Plaid window that is rendered by the Web Payments SDK:

![A graphic showing the Plaid ACH window that is rendered by the Web Payments SDK.](https://images.ctfassets.net/1nw4q0oohfju/59aBiC4oxTYxWMEY9d0Gr3/564e516fd1ab6e58b656f7794d71768d/plaid-window-web-payments-sdk.png?fm=webp)

You can find a [complete example](https://github.com/square/web-payments-quickstart/blob/main/public/examples/ach.html) of the code on GitHub.

#### Important

- ACH bank transfers are only supported by the Web Payments SDK and the [Payments API](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-refunds) in the United States. For more information, see [Supported Payment Methods by Country](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payment-card-support-by-country).
- Square is required to capture authorization for any one-time or recurring ACH payments. This authorization must appear as part of the payment flow for an application. Buyers accept authorizations by interacting with a user interface element of the payment form, such as a “Pay” or “Submit” button.

The following steps involve updating index.html in the root directory of the application to add the ACH payment method.

[anchor link for 1-attach-ach-to-the-page](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/add-ach#1-attach-ach-to-the-page)

Link to section

## 1\. Attach ACH to the page

The following code attaches the ACH method to the page:

1. Add the following HTML elements to the body of index.html before the existing card payment elements:

















Copy







Expand











```

    <fieldset class="buyer-inputs">
      <input
        type="text"
        autocomplete="given-name"
        aria-required="true"
        aria-label="First Name"
        required="required"
        placeholder="Given Name"
        name="givenName"
        spellcheck="false"
      />

      <input
        type="text"
        autocomplete="family-name"
        aria-required="true"
        aria-label="Last Name"
        required="required"
        placeholder="Family Name"
        name="familyName"
        spellcheck="false"
      />
    </fieldset>
    <button id="ach-button">Pay with Bank Account</button>
```











The HTML for the body of index.html should look like the following:

















Copy







Expand











```

<body>
     <form id="payment-form">
        <fieldset class="buyer-inputs">
         <input
           type="text"
           autocomplete="given-name"
           aria-required="true"
           aria-label="First Name"
           required="required"
           placeholder="Given Name"
           name="givenName"
           spellcheck="false"
         />

         <input
           type="text"
           autocomplete="family-name"
           aria-required="true"
           aria-label="Last Name"
           required="required"
           placeholder="Family Name"
           name="familyName"
           spellcheck="false"
         />
       </fieldset>
       <button id="ach-button" type="button">Pay with Bank Account</button>
      </form>
     <div id="payment-status-container"></div>
</body>
```

2. Add the [payments](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments/objects/Payments) object so that the application can instantiate the ACH payment method instance. Substitute the IDs from the Developer Console for the placeholder `({APPLICATION_ID}` and `{LOCATION_ID})` values:

















Copy







Expand











```

const payments = await Square.payments(
     applicationId: '{APPLICATION_ID}',
     locationId: '{LOCATION_ID}');
```

3. Add an `initializeACH` function after the `initializeCard` function in the `<script>` tag.

In the [options](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments/objects/AchOptions) for initializing the ACH payment method, add the [redirectURI](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments/objects/AchOptions#AchOptions.redirectURI) and [transactionId](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/sdks/web/payments/objects/AchOptions#AchOptions.transactionId) parameters to the `payments.ach` object property. The `redirectURI` cannot contain query parameters; if they're present, an error is returned.

The `redirectURI` repopulates the payment flow and reinitializes the Web Payments SDK payment form from either the URI or the `transactionId`. The `transactionId` is added to the URI as a query parameter.

















Copy







Expand











```

    async function initializeACH(payments) {
      const ach = await payments.ach({ redirectURI, transactionId });
      // Note: ACH doesn't have an .attach(...) method
      // the ACH auth flow is triggered by .tokenize(...)
      return ach;
    }
```

4. In the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener, add code to initialize the ACH payment method:


   - `let ach;`
   - `ach = await initializeACH(payments);`

After adding the previous code, the listener should look like the following:

Copy

Expand

```

async function initializeACH(payments); {
     let card;
     let ach;
     try {
       card = await initializeCard(payments);
       ach = await initializeACH(payments);
     } catch (e) {
       console.error('Initializing Card or ACH Authorization failed.', e);
       return;
     }
}
```

**Test the application**

Start your local test server and navigate to it in your browser. If you're following the quickstart guide steps in the [README](https://github.com/square/web-payments-quickstart/blob/main/README.md), the default URL is http://localhost:3000.

## 2\. Get the payment token from the ACH payment method

1. Include the `ontokenization` event listener to get access to the payment token result.

Add the following code after `// Checkpoint 2` in the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener function:

















Copy







Expand











```

ach.addEventListener(`ontokenization`, function (event) {
     const { tokenResult, error } = event.detail;
     if (error) {
       // add code here to handle error
     } else if (tokenResult.status == 'OK') {
       const paymentResults = await createPayment(tokenResult.token);
     }
});
```











The `ontokenization` event fires after a buyer authorizes a payment using Plaid.

2. Update the `tokenize` function to:


   - Take in a second optional `options` parameter.
   - Update the `paymentMethod.tokenize` call to include the `options` parameter.

Copy

Expand

```

function tokenize(paymentMethod, options = {}) {
   paymentMethod.tokenize(options);
 }
```

3. Add the following two helper functions after the `tokenize` function in the `<script>` tag:

















Copy







Expand











```

    function getBillingContact(form) {
      const formData = new FormData(form);
      // It's expected that the developer performs form field validation,
      // which doesn't occur in this example.
      return {
        givenName: formData.get('givenName'),
        familyName: formData.get('familyName'),
      };
    }

    function getACHOptions(form) {
      const billingContact = getBillingContact(form);
      const accountHolderName = `${billingContact.givenName} ${billingContact.familyName}`;

      return {
        accountHolderName,
        intent: 'CHARGE',
        amount: '5.00',
        currency: 'USD'
      };
    }
```

4. Update the `handlePaymentMethodSubmission` function to:


   - Take in a third `options` parameter.
   - Update the `tokenize` call to add `options` as the second parameter.

Copy

Expand

```

 async function handlePaymentMethodSubmission(
   event,
   paymentMethod,
   options // Add the options parameter here
 ) {
     // update the tokenize function to add an `options` parameter.
     tokenize(paymentMethod, options);
   }
```

5. Add the following code in the `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async function () {` function:

















Copy







Expand











```

    const achButton = document.getElementById('ach-button');
    achButton.addEventListener('click', async function (event) {
      const paymentForm = document.getElementById('payment-form');
      const achOptions = getACHOptions(paymentForm);
      await handlePaymentMethodSubmission(event, ach, achOptions);
      // tokenize
      // ACH with the `accountHolderName` as an option.
    });
```

6. Update the `handlePaymentMethodSubmission` function to disable the `achButton` when tokenizing the payment. Add `achButton.disabled = true;`.

















Copy







Expand











```

    async function handlePaymentMethodSubmission(event, paymentMethod, options) {
      event.preventDefault();

      try {
        // disable the submit button as we await tokenization and make a
        // payment request.
        cardButton.disabled = true;
        achButton.disabled = true; // Add this line.
        tokenize(paymentMethod, options);
      } catch (e) {
        // add code here to handle errors
      }
    }
```

7. Update the `ontokenization` event listener to re-enable the `achButton` during a failed payment. Add `achButton.disabled = false;`.

















Copy







Expand











```

ach.addEventListener(`ontokenization`, function (event) {
     const { tokenResult, error } = event.detail;
     if (error) {
       cardButton.disabled = false;
       achButton.disabled = false; // Add this line.
       // add code here to handle errors
     } else if (tokenResult.status === `OK`) {
       console.log(`got payment token: ${tokenResult.token}`);
       try {
         const paymentResults = await createPayment(tokenResult.token);
       } catch (e) {
         cardButton.disabled = false;
         achButton.disabled = false;
         // add code here to handle errors
       }
     }
};
```

8. Add the following `try...catch` statement with the `ach.tokenize()` call to trigger the ACH authentication flow.

















Copy







Expand











```

try {
     await ach.tokenize({
       accountHolderName: 'John Smith',
       intent: 'CHARGE',
       amount: '5.00',
       currency: 'USD'
     });
} catch (e) {
     console.error(e);
}
```


**Test the application**

This test simulates submitting bank account details and confirming the bank debit authorization for the payment.

1. Navigate to your test service (defaults to http://localhost:3000).

2. Enter a first and last name.

3. Choose the **Pay with Bank Account** button.

4. In the Plaid dialog box, enter **user\_good** for the name and **pass\_good** for the password. These test values are provided by the Plaid API and might change in the future.

5. Choose a bank.

6. When prompted, confirm the payment details.

#### Important





If you added your own ACH authorization text in the application, you must remove the text and not add any additional text. The Web Payments SDK provides the ACH authorization text in the user prompt, which contains all the bank transfer authorization instructions for the buyer to follow.







#### Success





You see the Plaid interface and are able to complete the flow using the test credentials provided at the bottom of the screen. You also confirm the payment details to allow bank account debit authorization. When these steps are completed, your application gets a payment token that's used to take an ACH bank transfer payment on your backend. The payment token that's returned uses the `bauth:` prefix.

## 3\. Create a payment with bank authorization

Add the payment token as the `source_id` in a new payment request with the amount that the buyer has authorized. Your application can then run the payment request to process the payment.

The following example sends a Payments API [CreatePayment](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/payments-api/create-payment) request to create a new payment for $5.00 USD:

Create payment

cURL

```

curl https://connect.squareup.com/v2/payments \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Square-Version: 2025-06-18' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "idempotency_key": "{UNIQUE_KEY}",
    "amount_money": {
      "amount": 500,
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "source_id": "{PAYMENT_TOKEN}"
  }'
```

[Try in API Explorer](https://developer.squareup.com/explorer/square_2025-06-18/payments-api/create-payment?params=N4IgRg9gJgngCgQwE4ILYFMAu6kGcQBcoAllOqgA4TYB2AxjAPoDW6MhIwAqgHICSARS4BRRgGlhATQC%2BIADQg0EAK41MjVBBptCoJasyEArAAYTCusqRJ09dgRBcAygBEQ0hbhVI66RqQ5gOABBSQBZYR4AFUYogHkJHlkPEAA3HFxiLQ4ARgA6E3cgA&env=production&v=1)

The `amount` and `currency` values need to match the payment to be processed with Payments API. The value for `amount`, unlike the value passed to the `ach.tokenize()` call, is expressed as a numeric number of cents.

## 4\. Verify ACH payments

After the application authorizes the buyer's bank account information and processes payments, verify the completed payments with the following developer tools:

- Check the Square Dashboard and review the reports on the **Transactions** page. Note that only completed transactions show up in a report. ACH transactions take about 2-3 days to settle and appear in a report. For more information, see [Square Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/devtools/seller-dashboard).

- Call the [GetPayment](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/payments-api/get-payment) endpoint to ensure that bank payments have been processed by reviewing the payment details. For more information about the ACH payment states, see [ACH Bank Transfer Payment](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-api/take-payments/ach-payments).

- Call the Square GraphQL endpoint to ensure that payments show up in the payments query results. For more information, see [Square GraphQL](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/devtools/graphql).
