## Overview

[Square gift cards](https://squareup.com/gift-cards) allow sellers to offer a complete gifting program that can boost sales and attract new customers. Gift cards can be purchased online or in person and redeemed at all of the seller's locations. Buyers can send gift cards to friends and family to introduce them to a seller's business.

Developers use the [Gift Cards API](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/gift-cards-api) and [Gift Card Activities API](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/gift-card-activities-api) to integrate gift cards into their applications. Watch the following video to see how the APIs work:

You can also send [Square GraphQL](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/devtools/graphql) queries for read-only access to gift card data and use [webhook events](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/webhooks) to keep track of activities.

#### Note

Sellers use [Square Point of Sale](https://squareup.com/point-of-sale) and the [Square Dashboard](https://app.squareup.com/dashboard/gift-cards) to sell, redeem, track, or reload Square gift cards. Sellers can publish an eGift Card Order Site where buyers can purchase gift cards.

Buyers can view and manage their gift cards from their [Square profile](https://profile.squareup.com/).

[anchor link for requirements-and-limitations](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#requirements-and-limitations)

Link to section

## Requirements and limitations

The following requirements, limitations, and other considerations apply when working with the Gift Cards API and Gift Card Activities API:

- **OAuth permissions** \- Applications using OAuth require `GIFTCARDS_READ` for read operations and `GIFTCARDS_WRITE` for write operations.

Additional permissions might be required in gift card flows. For example:


  - `CUSTOMERS_READ` \- To get a customer ID to link a gift card.
  - `PAYMENTS_WRITE` \- To [charge a gift card on file](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/manage-gift-cards-on-file#take-gift-card-on-file-payment).
  - `PAYMENTS_WRITE` and `ORDERS_WRITE` \- To activate or reload gift cards using Orders API integration.

Learn more about [OAuth](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/oauth-api/overview) and [endpoint permission requirements](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/oauth-api/square-permissions##gift-cards).

- **Gift card delivery** \- The developer is responsible for [delivering information for digital gift cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/sell-gift-cards#deliver-gift-cards) created using the Gift Cards API.

- **Security of custom GANs** \- The developer is responsible for ensuring the security of [custom GANs](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#custom-gans). For example, to mitigate the risk of fraud, don't use repeatable patterns or GANs that are easy to guess (such as 12345678).

- **No application fees** \- Developers cannot collect application fees for gift card payments. `CreatePayment` returns a `BAD_REQUEST` error if the `app_fee_money` field is included in a request to create a Square gift card payment.


- **Load fees** \- Sellers in the following countries pay 2.5% of the amount added to a Square gift card, in addition to standard payment processing rates:


  - Australia
  - Canada
  - United States

Load fees apply to `ACTIVATE`, `LOAD`, and `ADJUST_INCREMENT` activities. There are no fees when a gift card is redeemed or refunded. For more information, see [Gift cards pricing](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-pricing#gift-cards-pricing).

Square deducts or refunds load fees in seller payouts. To see all load fee deductions and refunds for a given payout, call [ListPayoutEntries](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/payouts-api/list-payout-entries) and iterate through the results to find following entry types:

  - [GIFT\_CARD\_LOAD\_FEE](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payouts-api/list-payout-entries#gift_card_load_fee)
  - [GIFT\_CARD\_LOAD\_FEE\_REFUND](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payouts-api/list-payout-entries#gift_card_load_fee_refund)
  - [UNDO\_GIFT\_CARD\_LOAD\_FEE\_REFUND](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payouts-api/list-payout-entries#undo_gift_card_load_fee_refund)
- **Customer linking limits** \- When saving [gift cards on file](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/manage-gift-cards-on-file):

  - The maximum number of gift cards you can link to a customer profile is 50.
  - The maximum number of customer profiles you can link to a gift card is 10.
- **Square Dashboard reporting** \- When third-party applications use [Orders API or Payments API integration](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#integration-with-orders-api-and-payments-api) to reload or redeem a gift card, the Square Dashboard reports include these transactions. In contrast, there's no reporting when reloading and redeeming gift cards using non-Square APIs.

All activated gift cards are listed in the Square Dashboard regardless of the system used to process the gift card order. However, if the gift card order was processed with non-Square APIs, the **Receipt** link to the transaction isn't available from the gift card's **Activity** card in the **Gift Cards** section.

- **Square API integration** \- Additional requirements and limitations apply when [integrating with other Square APIs](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#integration-with-square-apis).

- **Activity history** \- `ACTIVATE`, `CLEAR_BALANCE`, and `IMPORT` activities that occurred before March 2, 2016, aren't included in `ListGiftCardActivities` results or when viewing the activity history in the Square Dashboard.

New gift cards have a `PENDING` state and zero balance. After creating a gift card, call `CreateGiftCardActivity` to activate it with an initial balance before first use. For steps, see [Sell Square Gift Cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/sell-gift-cards).

The `id` and `gan` fields are used in API requests. For example, use:

- `gan` with the Web Payments SDK or In-App Payments SDK to generate a `source_id` for a gift card payment in a `CreatePayment` request.
- `id` as the `source_id` for a gift card on file payment in a `CreatePayment` request.
- `id` as the `destination_id` when issuing store credit in a `CreateRefund` request. This is an alternative method for activating a gift card.

## Gift Card Activities API

You can activate a gift card with a balance, load additional funds, redeem the gift card for purchases, and create other activities that change the gift card balance or state.

A `CreateGiftCardActivity` request defines a specific activity `type` and includes a corresponding `<activity-type>_activity_details` field that provides the information needed to create the activity. The following example creates an `ACTIVATE` type based on the provided `activate_activity_details`:

### Supported activity types for CreateGiftCardActivity

Gift card activities are used to manage a gift card's balance or state. You can use the `CreateGiftCardActivity` endpoint to create the following activity types:

| Activity type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ACTIVATE` | Activates a gift card with a balance. A gift card must be in the `ACTIVE` state to be used for any other activity. For more information, see [Sell Square Gift Cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/sell-gift-cards).<br>Details field: [activate\_activity\_details](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/GiftCardActivityActivate) |
| `LOAD` | Loads a gift card with additional funds. For more information, see [Reload Square Gift Cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/reload-gift-cards).<br>Details field: [load\_activity\_details](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/GiftCardActivityLoad) |
| `REDEEM` | Redeems funds from a gift card after a gift card payment.<br>If your application uses the Payments API to make a gift card payment, Square automatically creates a `REDEEM` activity that updates the gift card balance after the payment is completed. For more information, see [Redeem Square Gift Cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/redeem-gift-cards).<br>Details field: [redeem\_activity\_details](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/GiftCardActivityRedeem) |
| `CLEAR_BALANCE` | Sets a gift card balance to zero. This activity should be called before reusing a physical gift card.<br>When a physical gift card reaches a zero balance for any reason, Square automatically unlinks all customers from the gift card. This behavior helps keep the linked customer profile setting up to date if the card is reused.<br>Details field: [clear\_balance\_activity\_details](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/GiftCardActivityClearBalance) |
| `DEACTIVATE` | Permanently blocks a gift card from any future balance-changing activities. This activity should be called to prevent a gift card from being used (for example, before discarding a physical gift card or if the card is lost or stolen).<br>Details field: [deactivate\_activity\_details](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/GiftCardActivityDeactivate) |
| `ADJUST_INCREMENT` | Increases a gift card balance when the adjustment isn't related to a gift card order or payment. To increase the balance based on gift card orders or payments, use the appropriate `LOAD`, `REFUND`, or `UNLINKED_ACTIVITY_REFUND` activity.<br>Details field: [adjust\_increment\_activity\_details](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/GiftCardActivityAdjustIncrement) |
| `ADJUST_DECREMENT` | Decreases a gift card balance when the adjustment isn't related to a gift card payment. To decrease the balance based on a gift card payment, use the `REDEEM` activity.<br>Details field: [adjust\_decrement\_activity\_details](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/GiftCardActivityAdjustDecrement) |
| `REFUND` | Adds money to a gift card from a refunded transaction. Refunds linked to a Square payment have a `payment_id`. Refunds to the same gift card used to make the payment have a `redeem_activity_id`.<br>If your application uses the Refunds API to refund a payment to a gift card, Square automatically creates a `REFUND` activity that updates the gift card balance. Applications that use a custom processing system for same-method gift card refundsRefunds a payment to the same gift card used to make the payment. must explicitly create a `REFUND` activity and specify the `redeem_activity_id`.<br>Details field: [refund\_activity\_details](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/GiftCardActivityRefund) |
| `UNLINKED_ACTIVITY_REFUND` | Adds money to a gift card from a refunded transaction that wasn't paid with the same gift card.<br>This activity type is used by applications that use a custom processing system for cross-method gift card refundsRefunds a payment to a gift card that wasn't used to make the payment..<br>Details field: [unlinked\_activity\_refund\_activity\_details](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/GiftCardActivityUnlinkedActivityRefund) |

[anchor link for unsupported-activity-types](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#unsupported-activity-types)

Link to section

#### Unsupported activity types

You cannot use `CreateGiftCardActivities` to create the following activity types:

- `BLOCK` or `UNBLOCK` \- Square manages these activities while processing chargeback transactions for disputed payments.
- `IMPORT` or `IMPORT_REVERSAL` \- Sellers must work with Square Support to import [third-party gift cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#third-party-gift-cards) or reverse previously imported gift cards.
- `TRANSFER_BALANCE_TO` or `TRANSFER_BALANCE_FROM` \- Square creates these activities when a buyer transfers money between gift cards linked to their [Square profile](https://profile.squareup.com/).

However, these activity types are included in `ListGiftCardActivities` results and invoke `gift_card.activity.created` and `gift_card.updated` [webhook events](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/webhooks).

#### Note

You can call `ListGiftCardActivities` to view all activities or a filtered set of activities. The response includes gift card activities initiated by sellers and buyers using Square products, third-party applications calling Square APIs, and Square. For more information, see [List gift card activities](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/retrieve-gift-cards-and-activities#list-gift-card-activities).

## Integration with Square APIs

Square provides integrated gift card workflows for applications that use the [Orders API](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/orders-api), [Payments API](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/payments-api), or [Refunds API](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/refund-api).

[anchor link for orders-api-integration-with-activate-and-load-activities](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#orders-api-integration-with-activate-and-load-activities)

Link to section

### Orders API integration with ACTIVATE and LOAD activities

With Orders API integration, Square reads information from the order used to sell or reload a gift card. You provide an `order_id` and `line_item_uid` (of the `GIFT_CARD` line item) when you create the `ACTIVATE` or `LOAD` activity. The following are typical high-level flows:

- **Selling a gift card** \- Includes creating an `ACTIVATE` activity:

`CreateOrder` -\> `CreatePayment` -\> `CreateGiftCard` -\> `CreateGiftCardActivity`

- **Reloading a gift card** \- Includes creating a `LOAD` activity:

`CreateOrder` -\> `CreatePayment` -\> `CreateGiftCardActivity`


Resulting `ACTIVATE` and `LOAD` activities include the `order_id` and `line_item_uid` you provided in the `CreateGiftCardActivity` request, as shown in the following examples. The amount of the `GIFT_CARD` line item is added to the gift card balance.

#### Requirements and limitations for Orders API integration

- `order_id` \- The specified order must be in the `COMPLETED` state before you can activate or load the gift card.

- `line_item_uid` \- The specified line item with the gift card amount must explicitly set `GIFT_CARD` as the `item_type`. Otherwise, the order isn't processed as a gift card sale and you cannot use Orders API integration to activate or load the gift card.

- If a gift card order is later refunded, the Refunds API doesn't automatically update the gift card balance. To deduct the funds from the balance, call `CreateGiftCardActivity` and create an `ADJUST_DECREMENT` activity with the `PURCHASE_WAS_REFUNDED` reason. Note that the Refunds API does update the balance after refunding a payment to a gift card.

### Payments API integration with REDEEM activities

With Payments API integration, Square automatically creates a `REDEEM` activity that updates the gift card balance after the payment is processed. Your application doesn't need to call `CreateGiftCardActivity`.

Resulting `REDEEM` activities have a `payment_id`, as shown in the following example. The payment amount is deducted from the gift card balance.

### Refunds API integration with REFUND activities

With Refunds API integration, you can process same-method gift card refundsRefunds a payment to the same gift card used to make the payment. and cross-method gift card refundsRefunds a payment to a gift card that wasn't used to make the payment.. Square automatically creates a `REFUND` activity that updates the gift card balance after the refund is processed. Your application doesn't need to call `CreateGiftCardActivity`.

#### Note

You can issue a cross-method refund to a new gift card by first calling `CreateGiftCard` to create the gift card and then refunding directly to the new gift card. Doing so automatically changes the state from `PENDING` to `ACTIVE`.

Resulting `REFUND` activities include a `payment_id` if the refund is linked to a payment processed by Square and a `redeem_activity_id` if the payment was redeemed from the same gift card. The refund amount is added to the gift card balance.

Link to section

#### Requirements and limitations for Refunds API integration

- Square API version 2024-08-21 or later is required for the following features related to cross-method refunds:
  - Using `RefundPayment` to create cross-method gift card refunds.
  - Using `GetRefund` or `ListRefunds` to retrieve cross-method gift card refunds. When using earlier Square API versions, `GetRefund` returns an `API_VERSION_INCOMPATIBLE` error and `ListRefunds` omits cross-method gift card refunds from the results.
  - Using `GetPayment` or `ListPayments` to get `refunded_money` or `refund_ids` details related to the refund. When using earlier Square API versions, this information is omitted from the returned payments. Therefore, the payment IDs in corresponding `REFUND` activity details aren't useful for tracking refund activity.
- Refunding to a new gift card activates the card by changing the `PENDING` state to `ACTIVE` and adding an initial balance equal to the refund amount. This process creates a `REFUND` activity but doesn't create an `ACTIVATE` activity.
- Gift cards with custom GANs cannot receive cross-method refunds using the Refunds API.

[anchor link for custom-refund-processing-non-square-apis](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#custom-refund-processing-non-square-apis)

Link to section

#### Custom refund processing (non-Square APIs)

If your application doesn't use the Refunds API to process refunds, you must call `CreateGiftCardActivity` to create the `REFUND` or `UNLINKED_ACTIVITY_REFUND` activity.

- For same-method gift card refundsRefunds a payment to the same gift card used to make the payment. \- Create a `REFUND` activity and provide the following activity details in the request:
  - `amount_money`
  - `redeem_activity_id`
  - `reference_id` (optional)
- For cross-method gift card refundsRefunds a payment to a gift card that wasn't used to make the payment. \- Create an `UNLINKED_ACTIVITY_REFUND` activity and provide the following activity details in the request:
  - `amount_money`
  - `reference_id` (optional)

`REFUND` and `UNLINKED_ACTIVITY_REFUND` activities created by custom processing systems don't have a `payment_id` because they aren't linked to a Square payment.

[anchor link for custom-gans](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#custom-gans)

Link to section

## Custom GANs

The `CreateGiftCard` endpoint allows you to specify a custom GAN when you create a gift card. The custom GAN that you provide in the request must meet the following requirements:

- The custom GAN must be unique for the Square seller account.
- The custom GAN must contain 8 to 20 alphanumeric characters. Note that only numeric characters can be used if you want to generate [QR codes or barcodes](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#scanning).
- The custom GAN cannot start with:
  - A bank identification number (BIN) pattern used by major credit cards (such as Visa, Mastercard, and American Express).
  - A BIN used by Square gift cards: 778273 (physical) or 778332 (digital).

Gift cards created with a custom GAN have a `gan_source` of `OTHER`.

#### Note

For an example `CreateGiftCard` request that creates a gift card with a custom GAN, see [Create or register the gift card](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/sell-gift-cards#create-gift-card).

Custom GANs can enable scenarios that aren't possible with Square-assigned GANs. For example, they can be used for gift card redemptions across multiple Square sellers and channels, to attach a value to non-gift-card items such as tickets, and to allow sellers to accept gift cards created by external sites. Gift cards with custom GANs can be redeemed just like gift cards with Square-assigned GANs.

Buyers use GANs to make gift card payments and check the gift card balance. It's the responsibility of the developer to ensure the security of their custom GANs. For example, to mitigate the risk of fraud, avoid using repeatable patterns or GANs that are easy to guess (such as 12345678).

You should be aware of the following limitation for gift cards with custom GANs:

- After using the `LinkCustomerToGiftCard` endpoint to add a gift card on file for a customer profile, the customer ID is added to the `customer_ids` field of the `gift_card` object. However, linked gift cards that have custom GANs aren't currently visible as a card on file for the customer in Square products, such as Square Point of Sale or the Square Dashboard.

Link to section

## QR code and barcode scanning

Although Square APIs don't provide native code-generation support, you can use a third-party solution to generate a QR code or barcode for digital gift cards. For example, the [Gift Card API Sample App](https://github.com/square/connect-api-examples/tree/master/connect-examples/v2/node_gift-cards/public/js/generate-barcode.js) uses a JavaScript library to generate barcodes.

When generating a QR code or barcode, the encoded message must include the gift card number (GAN) in the following format:

> `sqgc://<GIFT_CARD_NUMBER>` (for example: `sqgc://82000571903`)

- Gift cards with a Square-assigned GAN have the `gan_source` field set to `SQUARE`. These gift cards can be scanned in Square Point of Sale.

- Gift cards with a [custom GAN](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#custom-gans) have the `gan_source` field set to `OTHER`. To support scanning with the `sqgc://` prefix, the GAN must:

  - Not start with a BIN used by major credit cards.
  - Not start with a BIN used by Square gift cards: 778273 (physical) or 778332 (digital).
  - Contain numeric characters only.
  - Pass the [Luhn algorithm check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).

Note that physical (plastic) Square gift cards are imprinted with a QR code and barcode.

[anchor link for physical-gift-cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#physical-gift-cards)

Link to section

## Physical gift cards

Note the following when working with physical (plastic) gift cards:

- Physical gift cards are imprinted with a 16-digit GAN and a barcode. The GAN is numeric only and starts with 778273. The GAN is stored in the `gan` field of the `GiftCard` object.

- To sell physical gift cards, the seller must have previously ordered the gift card from Square and the gift card must be unused. Sellers can [order a pack of Square gift cards](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/5393-order-your-square-gift-cards) in the Square Dashboard.

- Testing physical gift cards in the Square Sandbox isn't supported.

- When a physical gift card reaches a zero balance for any reason, Square automatically unlinks all customers from the gift card. This behavior helps keep the linked customer profiles setting current if the card is reused.


[anchor link for third-party-gift-cards](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#third-party-gift-cards)

Link to section

## Third-party gift cards

If a seller previously purchased gift cards from another gift card provider (not from Square) and sold them to customers, the seller must follow a one-time process with Square Support to import these third-party gift cards into Square. The seller can then accept these gift cards for redemption like Square gift cards. Third-party gift cards cannot be reloaded.

For third-party gift cards, the `gan` field can contain a maximum of 255 characters and `gan_source` is `OTHER`.

#### Note

If you attempt to migrate third-party gift cards by creating digital Square gift cards programmatically, you might receive compliance limit or rate limit errors. For more information, [contact Developer Support](https://squareup.com/help/contact?panel=BF53A9C8EF68).

[anchor link for sandbox-testing](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#sandbox-testing)

Link to section

## Sandbox testing

You can create and manage Square gift cards in the [Square Sandbox](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/devtools/sandbox/overview). In addition, Square provides a test value that you can use to test gift card payments. For more information, see [Testing gift card payments in the Sandbox](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/redeem-gift-cards#sandbox-gift-card-payments).

The following limitations apply to testing gift card payments in the Sandbox:

- Creating, managing, and testing with physical gift cards isn't supported.
- The Virtual Terminal doesn't accept gift card payments.
- The Web Payments SDK and In-App Payments SDK only accept Sandbox test values provided by Square. These values aren't tied to any gift cards in your account, so you cannot check whether the balance of the gift card is updated.

[anchor link for compliance-limits](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#compliance-limits)

Link to section

## Compliance limits

Square enforces the following compliance limits for gift card activities that load funds onto digital or physical gift cards:

- **Maximum balance amount per gift card** \- The maximum amount for a gift card balance.
- **Maximum load amount per gift card per day** \- The maximum amount that can be loaded onto a gift card in a 24-hour period.
- **Maximum load amount per payment card per day** \- The maximum amount that a single payment card can load onto gift cards in a 24-hour period.
- **Maximum outstanding balance amount per seller** \- The maximum amount of the total outstanding balance across all gift cards issued for a single seller.

If a limit is exceeded, the `CreateGiftCardActivity` endpoint [returns an error](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/gift-cards/using-gift-cards-api#compliance-limit-errors) and doesn't complete the activity.

Link to section

### Activity type is changed from UNLINKED\_ACTIVITY\_REFUND to REFUND for cross-tender refunds made from Square products

Effective date: 2022-06-16

All cross-tender refunds made from Square Point of Sale or the Square Dashboard are now processed as `REFUND` activities instead of `UNLINKED_ACTIVITY_REFUND` activities. This type of refund occurs when a gift card is refunded for a payment that was processed by Square and paid for using a credit card or different gift card. The resulting `REFUND` activity has a `payment_id` but doesn't have a `redeem_activity_id`.

Existing `UNLINKED_ACTIVITY_REFUND` activities that represent cross-tender refunds made from Square Point of Sale or the Square Dashboard are now also returned as `REFUND` activities for a `ListGiftCardActivities` request. This change applies to all Square versions.

However, new and existing `UNLINKED_ACTIVITY_REFUND` activities that are explicitly created by third-party applications continue to be returned as `UNLINKED_ACTIVITY_REFUND` activities.
