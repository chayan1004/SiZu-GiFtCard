## Overview

The [Orders API](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/orders-api) can record purchase items, calculate totals, confirm payments, track an order's progress through fulfillment, and update a catalog inventory. It can also create fulfillment orders and send them to the Square Point of Sale application for fulfillment.

#### Important

There is no transaction fee for orders paid using Square payments. If you want to use the Square Orders API with a non-Square payments provider, there is a 1% fee per transaction. For more information, [contact us](https://squareup.com/help/contact?prefill=developer_api).

## Orders components

The following are some of the key data elements for the Orders API:

- **Orders** \- An order is a top-level container representing a request to purchase goods or services from a business. Every order includes fields for line item details, fulfillment details, and order summary data, such as the location ID credited with the order and the total amount of taxes collected.

- **Line items** \- Individual items that are purchased as part of the order (for example, an order for a sandwich and two cups of tea). Each line item can have one or more modifiers to represent an available size or color (for example, a chicken sandwich with extra mustard). Line items and modifiers can be built from [CatalogItemVariation](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/CatalogItemVariation) and [CatalogModifier](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/CatalogModifier) objects or created ad hoc (at the time of creation).

- **Price adjustments** \- An order (or individual line items) might be eligible for discounts or subject to service charges and taxes. The Orders API calculates and applies any price adjustments at the order or line item level. Price adjustments can be configured as Catalog API objects or created ad hoc. For more information, see [Order Price Adjustments](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/price-adjustments).

- **Fulfillment information** \- Additional details about how to fulfill an order, such as the customer's name or the order pick up time. Every order that has fulfillment information is pushed to the Square Dashboard Order Manager when paid, so that sellers can manage order fulfillment. For more information, see [Manage Order Fulfillments](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/fulfillments).

- **Order source** \- Tracks the digital or physical source of the order. Orders can be searched or retrieved by the source.


For more information, see [Orders objects and data types](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/how-it-works#orders-objects-and-datatypes).

## Integrating with the Orders API

The Orders API integrates seamlessly with other Square APIs and resources to expand the functionality of your application.

[anchor link for square-order-visibility](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/what-it-does#square-order-visibility)

Link to section

### Square Order visibility

Orders with fulfillment that have been fully paid are pushed to the Square Point of Sale and Square Dashboard Order Manager so that sellers can manage fulfillment with Square. The Orders API supports three types of fulfillment orders: Pickup, Shipment, and Delivery. For more information, see [Add fulfillment details](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/create-orders#add-fulfillment-details).

The Orders API can also get orders that are originated and completed on the Square Point of Sale. Such an order might have the `Order.source` field set to `SQUARE_POS`. Any associated payments will have the `Payment.application_details.` [square\_product](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/enums/ApplicationDetailsExternalSquareProduct) field set to `SQUARE_POS`. If an order is created while Point of Sale is in Offline mode, the `created_at` timestamp is set to the time that a Square server received the create request from Point of Sale.

Any Order that is created for the Square account that your application is connected to is visible to your application, regardless if it was created by Square, your application, or an application published by another developer. If another application attaches [custom attributes](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-custom-attributes-api/overview) to an order, your application may not see them depending on the [visibility](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-custom-attributes-api/custom-attribute-definitions#create-an-order-custom-attribute-definition) of the custom attribute.

[anchor link for payments](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/what-it-does#payments)

Link to section

### Payments

Link your payments to `Order` objects to itemize sales and apply price modifiers such as taxes, discounts, and service charges. You can also use the Orders API to retrieve any payment activity associated with a sale, whether from the Square Point of Sale, invoices, or an integration build with the Payments API and Orders API. For more information, see [Pay for Orders](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/pay-for-orders).

[anchor link for catalog](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/what-it-does#catalog)

Link to section

### Catalog

Line items, line item modifiers, taxes, and discounts can all be defined as catalog objects. The Orders API reaches its full range of capabilities when orders are built using Square [Catalog objects](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/catalog-api/what-it-does).

Key advantages to using catalog item variations and other catalog objects include:

- Orders that reference catalog IDs for taxes and discounts are automatically calculated and applied to these price modifiers.
- Orders with ad-hoc items can still get the correct tax amounts when letting Square [automatically apply taxes](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/apply-taxes-and-discounts/auto-apply-taxes) by using a seller-defined [CatalogTax](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/CatalogTax).
- Orders that reference catalog line items use details defined in the catalog, such as the item name, price, and [measurement unit](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/create-orders#catalog-variations-with-measurement-units).
- When these orders are completed or refunded, Square updates the inventory for those items.

Use the Catalog API to [build a catalog](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/catalog-api/build-with-catalog) and unlock the full range of capabilities of the Orders API. For more information about integrating orders with the catalog, see [Create Orders](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/create-orders).

#### Did you know?

Orders can also be built from ad hoc line items defined when the `Order` object is created. You only need to supply an item name and price.

[anchor link for customers](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/what-it-does#customers)

Link to section

### Customers

`Order` objects can reference a customer profile. You can later use `SearchOrders` to search orders by customer. For more information about making customer profiles, see [Manage Customer Profiles](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/use-the-api/keep-records). To learn about considerations for assigning a customer to an order, see [Linking customers to orders and payments](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/use-the-api/integrate-with-other-services#link-customers-to-orders).

[anchor link for webhooks](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/orders-api/what-it-does#webhooks)

Link to section

## Webhooks

A webhook is a subscription that notifies you when a Square event occurs. The Orders API supports the following events:

| Event | Permission | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [order.created](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/webhooks/order.created) | `ORDERS_READ` | An [Order](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/Order) was created. |
| [order.fulfillment.updated](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/webhooks/order.fulfillment.updated) | `ORDERS_READ` | An [OrderFulfillment](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/OrderFulfillment) was created or updated. |
| [order.updated](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/webhooks/order.updated) | `ORDERS_READ` | An [Order](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/objects/order) was updated. |

For more information about using webhooks, see [Square Webhooks](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/webhooks/overview). For a list of webhook events you can subscribe to, see [Webhook Events Reference](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/webhooks/v2webhook-events-tech-ref).
