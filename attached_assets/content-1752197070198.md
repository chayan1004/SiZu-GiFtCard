# Commerce APIs

The [Square Developer platform](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/homepage) provides commerce APIs that applications can use to help sellers run their online or brick-and-mortar businesses. Sellers can use Square commerce and [eCommerce APIs](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/ecommerce-api) to process orders, manage catalogs, track inventory, book appointments, and more.

In addition to commerce APIs, you can use Square [payments](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-overview), [customer](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers), [staff](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/staff), and [merchant](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/merchant-details) APIs to help sellers manage all aspects of their business.
