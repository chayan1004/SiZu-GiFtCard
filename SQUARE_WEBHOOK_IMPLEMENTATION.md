# Square Webhook Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive webhook processing for Square payment events. The system now handles all critical order lifecycle events and payment status updates.

## Implemented Webhook Event Handlers

### 1. Order Events
- **order.created** - Tracks new orders when created
  - Logs order details (ID, location, state, version)
  - Stores payment record for tracking
  - Ready for gift card activation workflow

- **order.updated** - Monitors order state changes
  - Tracks order version updates
  - Updates transaction status based on state:
    - COMPLETED → marks transaction as completed
    - CANCELED → marks transaction as failed
  - Maintains audit trail of all changes

- **order.fulfillment.updated** - Tracks gift card delivery
  - Monitors fulfillment state transitions
  - Logs all state changes (e.g., PROPOSED → RESERVED → COMPLETED)
  - Creates fraud alerts for failed fulfillments
  - Enables tracking of gift card delivery status

### 2. System Events
- **oauth.authorization.revoked** - Critical security monitoring
  - Creates CRITICAL severity fraud alert
  - Logs revocation details (who, when, why)
  - Warns about payment processing impact
