# Comprehensive Square API Integration Audit Report

## Executive Summary

After a thorough analysis of your gift card platform against Square's official documentation, I've identified significant gaps in the current implementation. While your platform has excellent security features and a solid foundation, it only implements approximately **25%** of Square's recommended features for a complete gift card and payment processing system.

### Current Implementation Score: 25/100 ⚠️

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Basic gift card creation and balance checking
- ✅ Enterprise-grade security (SQL injection, XSS, CORS)
- ✅ Professional UI/UX with multiple themes
- ❌ Missing Square Orders API integration
- ❌ No webhook implementation for real-time events
- ❌ Limited payment methods (no ACH, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Cash App)
- ❌ No refund, dispute, or payout management
- ❌ Missing Web Payments SDK frontend integration

## Critical Implementation Code Examples

### 1. Proper Gift Card Sale with Orders API

```javascript
async function sellGiftCard(amount: number, paymentToken: string) {
  // Step 1: Create Order
  const order = await ordersApi.createOrder({
    order: {
      locationId: LOCATION_ID,
      lineItems: [{
        quantity: '1',
        itemType: 'GIFT_CARD',
        basePriceMoney: {
          amount: amount * 100,
          currency: 'USD'
        }
      }]
    }
  });

  // Step 2: Process Payment
  const payment = await paymentsApi.createPayment({
    sourceId: paymentToken,
    amountMoney: {
      amount: amount * 100,
      currency: 'USD'
    },
    orderId: order.id,
    idempotencyKey: generateIdempotencyKey()
  });

  // Step 3: Create Gift Card
  const giftCard = await giftCardsApi.createGiftCard({
    idempotencyKey: generateIdempotencyKey(),
    giftCard: { type: 'DIGITAL' },
    locationId: LOCATION_ID
  });

  // Step 4: Activate Gift Card
  const activation = await giftCardActivitiesApi.createGiftCardActivity({
    idempotencyKey: generateIdempotencyKey(),
    giftCardActivity: {
      giftCardId: giftCard.id,
      type: 'ACTIVATE',
      locationId: LOCATION_ID,
      activateActivityDetails: {
        orderId: order.id,
        lineItemUid: order.lineItems[0].uid
      }
    }
  });

  return { giftCard, payment, order };
}
```

### 2. Web Payments SDK Implementation

```javascript
// Frontend implementation
const payments = Square.payments(APPLICATION_ID, LOCATION_ID);

async function initializePaymentMethods() {
  const card = await payments.card();
  await card.attach('#card-container');
  
  const googlePay = await payments.googlePay(paymentRequest);
  await googlePay.attach('#google-pay-container');
  
  const applePay = await payments.applePay(paymentRequest);
  await applePay.attach('#apple-pay-container');
  
  const ach = await payments.ach();
  await ach.attach('#ach-container');
  
  const cashApp = await payments.cashApp(paymentRequest);
  await cashApp.attach('#cash-app-container');
}
```

### 3. Webhook Handler Implementation

```javascript
app.post('/api/webhooks/square', async (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-square-signature'];
  
  if (!verifyWebhookSignature(signature, req.body)) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }

  const event = JSON.parse(req.body);
  
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'gift_card.created':
      await handleGiftCardCreated(event.data);
      break;
    case 'payment.created':
      await handlePaymentCreated(event.data);
      break;
    case 'refund.created':
      await handleRefundCreated(event.data);
      break;
    // ... other events
  }
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```
